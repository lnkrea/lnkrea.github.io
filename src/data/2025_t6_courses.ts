For example, shareholders use accounting information to determine the intrinsic value of the stock, which helps them to decide whether to buy, hold, or sell the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share. Bankers and lenders rely on firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial statements in order to decide whether to lend money or not to firms. The course also discusses the significance of relevant accounting standards and the evolving regulatory landscape in the preparation and interpretation of financial statements. This course is also designed to provide students with a deeper understanding of nature and workings of corporate financial management. The course aims to provide the framework, concepts, and tools for analysing financial decisions based on fundamental principles of modern financial theory. It introduces the students to the many ways in which corporate management both evaluates investment opportunities and finances investments. It also teaches basic financial concepts and provides students with the tools necessary for evaluating the intrinsic value of a corporation, as well as assessing a corporation's effectiveness in maximizing its value. Further, the course highlights the important real-world applications of the various theories.",

Personal computers in its rudimentary avatar entered our work spaces only with the economic liberalization of the early 1990s. Both mobile telephony and the Internet were born a few more years later in 1995. The turn of the millennium saw the market getting flooded with laptops with the early versions testing our weight lifting skills. Forget 25 years, just about 10 years back there were no smartphones, no Cloud Computing as we know it today, no connected intelligent devices and most importantly no Facebook! To be more generic, there was no social media space at all a decade ago. Linked In was launched in 2003; Facebook in 2004 and Tweets were born, thanks to Twitter in 2006. The first version of iPhone was launched in 2007. The iPad hit the market in 2010. Thus, what we consider as a technology\u00e2\u20ac\u201cdeluged world is a fairly nascent world. The overwhelming envelope of technology is affecting every sphere of our life. In the personal space, the way we communicate, interact and socialize has significantly altered with technology being the key harbinger of this change. In the business space, the way we produce, transport, sell and service in any business is all governed by some interesting facet of technology. This 10 Session module focuses on the all-pervading influence of technology in the realm of Marketing. The main objective of this course is to take the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brick\u00e2\u20ac\u009d activities to the next level of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Click\u00e2\u20ac\u009d activities and leverage the power of the Web to the students of Marketing.

The first three weeks of the course focus on the classical tradition of political economy, centred around the work of Adam Smith and David Ricardo. This is followed by two weeks of Marxian political economy, and two weeks on neo-classical economic thought. After an excursus into institutional, socialist, utopian, and historical traditions in economics, the course concludes with a deep engagement with the Keynesian revolution and its lasting influence on the field.

Given the extent to which scholars have come to rely on texts to narrate the history of medieval South Asia, when and for what reasons might one turn towards physical artifacts and objects as sources of historical information? This course answers the aforementioned questions by bringing attention to artifactual cultures spanning 550 years in South Asia, beginning towards the end of the 12th century and concluding in the mid- eighteenth century. \n\nThe course commences with framing questions around \u201cthe medieval\u201d in South Asian History and the ways in which that concept comes to inform debates around community and stateformation, the exercise of sovereignty and power, religiosity, patronage, travel, colonialism, and more recently, populism and nationalism. Subsequently, the course explores the ways in which the periodization of the medieval comes to encompass visual artifacts spanning the Ghurid, Mamluk, Khalji, Tughlaq, Vijayanagara, Sharqi, Lodhi and Mughal periods. The course ends with the debates surrounding the emergence of an \u201cearly modern period\u201d in South Asian history and the peculiar manner in which the artefactual culture of medieval south Asia comes into conversation with that of the early modern. At the broadest level the course will not only introduce students to a wide array of works of art and architecture in the region, it will also encourage them to develop interpretative descriptions of these works by drawing on a variety of primary and secondary sources.",

Due to vagueness in its scope, justice as a personal virtue has often been sidelined since the aretaic turn in the 20th century. Restricting its scope to socio-political dimensions, contemporary discourses on the virtue of justice often miss the origin, nature and function of justice in individual persons. Elizabeth Anscombe rightly says: \u201cOne of the most important insights of modern times\u2026[is] that injustice may be nobody\u2019s fault, and that what is required is good [socio-political] arrangement\u201d (\u201cDoes Oxford Moral Philosophy Corrupt Youth?\u201d, 1957). This course aims at bridging this existing gap between the socio-political and the personal dimensions of the virtue of justice. What better way to do this than by looking at the holistic approaches to justice in classical philosophy? The course will explore the notion of justice both as a moral virtue and as a political virtue through the selected works of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. It will begin by examining Socrates\u2019 call for justice in Apology and then his refusal to \u2018unjustly\u2019 break his agreement with the city laws in Crito. The course will then shift its focus to Plato\u2019s treatment of the ethical and political dimensions of justice in his Republic. This will involve discussions on Plato\u2019s account of a just city (kallipolis), its analogy with human soul, justice & happiness, family, political regimes, role of women, philosophers & artists in society, and education. After an extensive discussion on Plato, the course will move on to discuss Aristotle\u2019s account of justice using his Nicomachean Ethics and Politics. It will first explore his idea of justice as a virtue of character through themes like general & particular justice, justice & virtue, justice in friendships, equity, and voluntariness in just actions. Students will then be introduced to Aristotle\u2019s account of political justice through his notions of political animal, city-state, its structure & goals, good citizens & their virtues, and ideal constitutions. The course will conclude by highlighting the relevance of the classical treatment of justice as a moral-political virtue in contemporary times.",

What are the implications of parsing this concept at the individual level or examining it in a relational or collective way? Philosophically, the concept of freedom plays out in the domain of metaphysics and ethics, with theories ranging from the libertarian, the compatibilist, and the deterministic. These transcendental ideas have had a subtle but definite impact on our constitutional guarantees for free speech on the one hand, and the restrictions placed on them on others. What implications does the information we have about inner processes have for the issue of agency? What are\nthe grounds, if any, for coercing opinion and behaviour through pressure? What is the space for freedom of religion in a secular state? What is the distinction between positive and negative liberty and how are these related to notions of libertarianism, collectivism, autonomy and free will? Finally, where is freedom situated in discussions on fairness and justice and what are alternative notions of freedom, for example, as a form of self-realisation or as a model for non-domination.

Developed into a full-fledged discipline in the past two decades globally, the ambiguity around the term often evades its complete understanding. Understanding curation outside of its museological origins theoretically opens up radical philosophical windows into understanding constructs of knowledge and experience. In this course, students will study the various frameworks offered by the curatorial mode, explore the ways in which the practice impacts its fields and its objects. They will grasp some basic tools that will help them in their practices in the future which may be as diverse as that of managers, mediators, interlocutors, dj\u2019s, walkers, care-givers or just simply - becoming allies.

What is majoritarianism and where do we locate the minorities in India? How do languages shape community identifications? How does popular culture inform identity formation in India? How are diasporic identities constructed and sustained? In the course \u2018Communities and Identities in India\u2019 we would ask several such questions and seek answers. This course intends to explore social identities and social locations in India from the perspectives of practices, diversities, and hierarchies around those practices. Expanding on the discourse of personal is political, this course aims to analyse how our everyday practices and identifications stem from larger community affiliations, stereotypes and othering. The course is divided into four parts - in the first part we will contextualise the significance of communities and identities at large, narrowing down to what they mean in India with special reference to secularism, nationalism and ethnic identities. In the second section we will look into social construction of identities through the prism of tribe, food and language. We will engage with identities at the margin e.g. from Ladakh, Kashmir and North-East, to name a few. This section will also capture the pulse of linguistic nationalism as the defining point of identity assertion in India on one hand and English language elitism as an expression of colonial lingering on the other. In the third segment we will examine the role of media, popular culture and identity and community formation in the diaspora. Through the intervention of television and sports, this section will examine how media(ted) identities inform community formations in India. In this section, students will also engage with transnational frameworks and diasporic identities. Having located the politics around community affiliations and collective identities in the conceptual and theoretical contexts, in the fourth and the last segment, students will undertake a small research project. \n",

Underlying this division was a hegemonic project of \"development\", an extended process of structural transformation associated with industrialization and modernization of economies and societies, largely led by and operating within nation-states. Since the heydays of modernization, this consensus has unravelled in four ways. First, there have been many normative critiques of development, as well as many alternative normative agendas for development (e.g. human development, inclusive development, sustainable development). Second, the centrality of the national scale is no longer taken for granted; development processes are understood to operate at multiple scales ranging from the local to the global. Third, both in popular and academic discourse, there has been a reconsideration of the respective roles played by governments, firms, non-governmental actors, social movements, etc. in the development process. Finally, in development scholarship, there has been a proliferation of the methodological and theoretical frameworks used to analyze the development process.\n\nIn this course, students will be introduced to different intellectual traditions of development scholarship, and their interactions with the world of policy-making and implementation. Accordingly, the course is divided into three modules. The first module, titled the \u201cHistory of Development Thought\u201d, helps students understand how ideas about development have evolved since the early 20th century. In the second module, titled \u201cMethodological Innovations\u201d, students are introduced to new approaches to development scholarship and its relationship with evidence drawn from the real world. The final module, titled \u201cDevelopment Dilemmas\u201d, picks up a sample of concrete dilemmas emerging from development debates in recent years.\nThis course will be reading and writing-intensive; in addition to weekly response essays, students will write a literature review and a position paper on a topic of their choice.\n",

This course introduces scholarship that seeks to expand this language so as to enable articulation of nuances that are otherwise lost. Critiquing the dominant colonial and postcolonial frameworks, it takes a fresh look at the imbrication of caste, community and coloniality in South Asia. Pushing beyond the usual impasse on the binaries of perpetration and victimhood, blame and guilt, culpability and innocence to concerns like epistemic injustice, collective responsibility, implicated subject and the pure concept of forgiveness, it explores problems like: how we come to inherit collective responsibility for acts of violence and injustice that may have preceded us or may not have committed directly, and yet on closer examination find ourselves variously implicated in. Apart from introducing new concepts, the course offers a reflection on contexts like Kashmir that make the intricacies, contradictions and overlaps between caste, community and coloniality manifest.",

Drawing on original texts, scholarly writings, discursive cultural production and social movements, we attempt to unravel how the study of, and response to, social organization in the Indian context generates often contradictory understandings of caste as social fact, experience of cultural identity, social imaginary, a fluid and potentially mobilizable social category, an instrument of power and domination, and dehumanizing technology of subjugation, humiliation, oppression and violence. The course attempts to trace the trajectory of epistemic understandings of caste from colonial understandings of social stratification to critical caste and technology studies, and their critical potential for interrogating the complex socio-economic, political, cultural and religious institutions and processes through which modern Indian society continues to reinscribe caste as an everyday social experience for over a billion people on the planet. Through the arc of the course, we will engage with the troubled ontological implications of social organization in Indian society, which tethers knowledge of self and other through lived experience while perpetuating forms of epistemic, infrastructural and arbitrary violence on historically oppressed and marginalized sections of society.\n",

The course will encourage learners to collaborate and innovate, based on their interests \nand experiment with professional technologies, be it hardware equipment or software. Through small-scale projects students will learn methods of recording sounds, manipulating them and stitching audio-visual narratives. Students interested in music will also be able to understand how to strike the right balance between sound design and backgrounds score in narratives. The three focal elements of the course are:\n1) Introduce students to multidisciplinary forms in art and technology, with a focus on philosophy of sound and listening\n2) Enable students with preliminary skills needed to handle the technical side of audio production\n3) Encourage collaboration between students having different interests (for example between animators and sound designers, or photographers and musicians) and move towardsfuturistic,immersive art design projects.\nClasses will involve practical and immersive tech sessions, interactions with industry\nprofessionals and exploration of global immersive art scene in the pre and post-internet era.\nTopics like phenomenology of sound, interdisciplinary approaches to art-technology, multimodal\ndocumentation techniques and communication will be explored.",

The term is divided into three modules, each pertaining to a fundamental aspect of writing fiction: Person, Plot, Place. We will explore what these are and how they relate to the work you hope to finally produce.

Through a series of readings of primary and associative texts, the fundamental task of the course will be to think through the idea of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpoetry of modernity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The poetry of modernity thrived in the metropolises of modernity but also away from it; found form in both heavily modernising imperial cities as well as in the cities forged by coloniality; was debated in the artists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 salons as much as in islands of individual genius; it talked back to the technologies of modernity as much as it turned away from them. Broadly it was a poetry of animation, alienation and contemplative ennui. The poetry of modernity was also transmedial (it found kinship with photography and art, cinema and new fiction), transnational (it flourished in several centres of contact between nationalities) and transitional, responding to an ephemeral, delirious, radically remade world. It is this network of opposites - the need to respond and revolt, to accommodate and alienate, to comply and dissent, to find fellowship but through extreme individuation- is what triggered the difficult and productive search for a new idiom and a new language of poetry. From the fundamental question of a broad definition, the course shall hence proceed to the more difficult question: is the poetry of modernity primarily a genre of poetry; or is it thus only when it is part of the experience and consciousness of modernity?",

When and how is a literary or artistic movement born, named, periodised, and canonised? And what does organising texts and writers into particular movements or periods do to the way in which we read them? The course will then make a distinction between historical periods and literary or artistic movements, the latter being defined, not merely chronologically, but in terms of specific literary and artistic goals shared across time, place, mediums, and genres. We will regard the movement in question as defined by critics retrospectively, as well as by the members themselves. And finally we will read Romanticism in relation to movements that preceded and succeeded it, as a way to gain insight into how movements fit into a historical continuum, how some movements are distinct and well defined while others are more nebulous and fluid, and why the notion of movements have at times been a point of contention among scholars.",

Following this tradition of feminist literary criticism, this course will involve studying selected writings of women in the twentieth century. As one would expect, any imagination of such a course would present several challenges. First, the category of \u201cwomen\u201d is a contested one and one must account for the diversity of experiences\u2014along the lines of class, caste, race, ethnicity, sexuality\u2014that resist such a universal categorization. Given this, one must contend with the following question: Do women across these boundaries have any unifying experiences or is the point of such a course to excavate difference even as it seeks to bring together disparate groups of persons under the category of \u201cwoman\u201d? Second, one must inevitably be cautious while trying to use traditional (masculinist) theories of literary criticism in order to read women\u2019s literatures even as one must resist a hasty assimilation of all women\u2019s literatures into existing categories of feminist literatures (and leave it at that). How has feminist literary criticism negotiated these challenges and sought to construct an analytical lens that is drawn from the works of these women writers? This course will provide students with an opportunity to think through some of these challenges and questions with the help of literary works written\u2014poetry, short stories, and essays\u2014by women in the twentieth century. The course\u2019s focus is primarily on Western literary traditions and thus, most writers included are from the West. Through close reading of these texts and attention to historical traditions and contexts within which these writers wrote, this course will unpack the shape of literary imaginations and landscapes that are specific to women writers of this century. In doing so, students will be encouraged to think about the role that women\u2019s literatures and feminist literary criticisms might play in shaping mainstream literary studies.",

It is a vital addition to the writing program of Krea University. Students will get the chance to engage with this thriving literary form, reading such writers as Nora Ephron, Julian Barnes, DR Nagaraj, William Hazlitt and Umberto Eco, among others. A good essay relies on a personalistic style but brings forth crucial understandings about the world we live in. Students will learn how to research an idea they are interested in, develop their thoughts along suitable lines, and forward an argument in elegant, concise language. Students will work on multiple short essays over the course of the term and one final longer essay. This is a reading and writing-heavy course, in which we will encourage exploring ideas from other academic disciplines.",

However, using the concept of the \u201cauteur\u201d, canons of cinema (and culture) often tend towards highlighting the works of \u201cgreat\u201d male directors, at the cost of ignoring the participation of women in cinema since the inception of film as a cultural form.

Beginning with the famous experiments undertaken by Gregor Mendel in the early 1860s, we move to the rediscovery of his work in 1900 and its employment in the elucidation of such aspects as linkage and crossing over, as well as chromosomal aberrations and mutations. The molecular basis for genetics finds root in the Evolutionary Synthesis and foundational work involving the implication of nucleic acid as genetic material. In this context, we study the chemical nature, physico-chemical structure and replication of DNA. Both DNA and RNAs are considered in their combined role for protein synthesis. The elucidation of the genetic code and the mechanism and regulation of gene action, such as with the operon model are investigated and their implications considered. Extrachromosomal inheritance will be treated as well. The course concludes with the promise and perils of genetic engineering (Recombinant DNA) and its applications, including, controversially, gene editing and cloning.\n",

The course will pay particular attention to the most critical crises associated with anthropogenic global change, and also on how these changes can impact health and well-being of humans through various mechanisms ranging from reduced access to ecosystem services (e.g., clean air and water) to the increased risk of emergence of novel diseases (e.g., COVID-19).\n",

Particular attention will be paid to the effects of environmental thinking in the colonial world as well as to contemporary issues, in particular, climate change and conservation. The themes of the course will be suitable to an introductory level approach to the subject such that students will be in a position to make intelligent and thoughtful contributions to a greater environmental consciousness through the work they may undertake in time to come. To this end, projects will be designed using course and supplemental material and with an emphasis on work conducted outside the classroom to be discussed and portrayedwithin it as final output",

The narrative from which this tapestry is woven is remarkably similar across geographies and cultures; that biodiversity is threatened due to human action such as deforestation and degradation, unsustainable harvest, and due to the fault-lines created by competing objectives of environmental protection and human development. Articulated this way, biodiversity, and lands that contain it, become scarce resources within a political economy. Responses to the biodiversity crisis within a political economy engenders the separation of humans from nature, the commodification of nature by projecting its economic value, and the relentless strengthening of centralization. In recent years however alternate narratives to the dominant political economy have emerged. One of these is the political ecology counter-narrative. Political ecology subsumes learning from multiple disciplines to analyze the appropriation of nature (including its distribution and consumption) as an inherently political process linked to social relations and control, and the analysis of embedded power relations, domination, and inequality that result from this process. Examined in this fashion, biodiversity conservation is not a value-neutral term, but one that needs to be critically unpacked from multiple perspectives including ecological justice and social equity.",

Do humans as moral agents have a moral obligation towards other living beings and environmental components? Do our moral obligations change knowing that the environment is the only moral subject? How do we define value? Are all values defined solely by reference to ourselves or our kind, or is there a realm of value that extends beyond the humandomain? This course illustrates the history of nature\u2014human relationship and the moral and ethical debates that emerge owing to the present dismal state of this relationship. Students learn about various ethical schools that are in place and further gain an in-depth understanding of the necessary ethical debates by comparing and contrasting these ethical viewpoints. After giving exposure to the theoretical underpinnings of environmental ethics, the second half of the course delves into the practice of ethics by charting out the trajectory of the growth of major environmental movements and the major treaties at the global scale. It will delve into present debates concerning resource conflicts, developmental goals, and societal values to locate the role of ethics in the human-environment relationship. With the advent of the discourses on climate change, the ethical response to the environment became an even more conflicted issue. This course ends with addressing the dilemma of the individuals\u2019 vs. institutions' responsibility and the larger effectiveness of ethical actions.\n",

This course differs from such an approach in that the focus is on the concepts and techniques adopted in remote sensing measurements. The course has three demonstration classes where students will be exposed to the remote sensing datasets with the guidance of the instructor.

Alternative economic models such as degrowth, steady-state, and doughnut economics have been proposed to this end. Philosophies such as Buen Vivir and Ubuntu have likewise attracted increasing attention. However, the complexities of the real world mean that there are few, if any, examples of large scale uptake of these philosophies or models. However, interesting case studies of large-scale transitions are underway in different parts of the world. For example, political churning of the past 2-3 years in Chile have led to a new draft constitution with progressive \u2013 even radical \u2013 ideas on social and environmental protections. \u2018Rights of Nature\u2019 are being contemplated and instituted in an increasing list of countries, perhaps most famously in Ecuador. Radical ideas on gender equality have emerged and been instituted in parts of Kurdistan. Yet, many of these initiatives are nascent and fragile. The new draft constitution of Chile may be defeated in a referendum, and the gender rights movement in Kurdistan may be motivated by strategic political concerns relating to identity. In this course, the purpose is to identify and study key examples of large-scale social, environmental and economic transitions of the past decade, and to interrogate the historical context in which these came about. We will ask whether these changes are robust, and whether progressive policies developed there could be carried over to similar contexts elsewhere in the Global South. The purpose is to come to an understanding of whether such changes were incidental and fleeting ,or whether genuine social tipping points were triggered.",

One of the earliest indications for the need to relook at classical physics was the blackbody emission spectrum. The experimental results were at variance with the prediction of classical physics. Max Planck proposed quantized exchanges of energy between the walls of the blackbody and the radiation within. This resolved the discrepancy between the theoretical predictions and the experimental observations. Einstein proposed quantized energy for the radiation field to explain the photoelectric effect. Bohr proposed non-radiating orbits for electrons to account for the stability of atoms and quantized angular momentum to explain their emissions spectra. All these ad hoc procedures found natural explanations in the quantum theory formulated by Heisenberg and Schrodinger. Their ideas were refined and put on firm scientific footing by Dirac, Pauli, Born, von Neumann, Jordan and others. ",

Empirical information gathered over centuries has been consolidated in a few statements called the laws of thermodynamics. In that sense, this subject is also one of the earliest theoretical formulations. Thermodynamics, in particular its nonequilibrium extension, is very important in biological sciences, environmental sciences, climatology and energy studies, to name a few. Entropy, one of the enigmatic notions in physics, was originally formulated by Clausius in the context of heat engines, the objects of study in this subject. A microscopic understanding of thermodynamics is sought in statistical physics. The contributions of greats like Boltzmann and Gibbs still form the foundation of the subject while Jayne\u2019s approach based on information theory is equally important. A brief introduction to these aspects is provided towards the end of the course. Why should one learn this subject? Extension to nonequilibrium systems is still an incomplete program. Of course, significant contributions in recent times include Jarzynsky-Crooks work fluctuation theorems, non-extensive thermodynamics and quantum thermodynamics.

While the need for quantum formulation may not arise in the description of all the optical phenomena, it is essential in many processes involving the electromagnetic field.   The quantum nature of the electromagnetic field was introduced as an adhoc requirement by Einstein to explain the photoelectric effect.   Of course, it is not Adhoc anymore.  Quantum field theory has formalized these notions.   Availability of laser has made it possible to perform experiments explicitly requiring quantum description.  These experiments range from testing the foundational aspects of quantum theory to manipulating quantum bits to perform computations.

Moreover, the British Psychological Society recommends incorporating qualitative research into undergraduate courses. Qualitative methods are prized for their ability to capture rich, nuanced data and unveil themes and categories inherent in the data. They enable researchers to derive meaning from lived experiences and narratives, decipher the nuances of language in expressing underlying psychic structures, and gain profound insights into human behaviour and social interactions. \n\nThroughout this course, students will delve into the philosophical foundations that underpin qualitative approaches in psychology. These approaches encompass a range of methods, including narrative analysis, language analysis, visual methods, and naturalistic observation. This course will be delivered using a workshop model, wherein students will engage in hands-on learning experiences, collaborative activities, and practical exercises to explore qualitative research methods. By the end of the course, students will have gained an understanding of the philosophical underpinnings of qualitative research. Additionally, they will have developed the skills to evaluate the quality of qualitative research, considering factors such as sampling techniques, triangulation, and the potential for generalizability.\n",

How are these concepts evaluated and quantified, and by whom? This course will provide an introduction to different ways of thinking about distressing states of mind, beginning in antiquity and moving onto the biopsychosocial model of contemporary clinical psychology. Following this history, the course will introduce contemporary psychopathological categories such as developmental, anxiety, mood, psychotic, and personality disorders along with the assessment instruments that are used to diagnose them. Additionally, students will explore how different theoretical frameworks, including cognitive-behavioural, psychodynamic, humanistic, and systemic perspectives, conceptualise these conditions, offering diverse lenses through which to understand and treat mental health issues. We will enhance our research-based understanding of the categories of mental illness via a close reading of first-person narratives of the experience of mental illness. In the final segment of the course, students will examine political movements that have significantly reshaped the discourses surrounding mental illness, reframing it as distress, disability, or divergence. Through this exploration, students will gain insight into the socio-political forces that influence perceptions of mental health and contribute to the evolution of mental health policies and practices. \n\n",

With a primary emphasis on the psychological processes associated with leadership and social change, this course should allow students to identify and examine the 'psychological' in the 'political'. In this course, we shall explore the critical role of leaders in solidarity movements as well as hate mobilisations. We shall explore questions of social stability, change and ideology- Why and how do individuals become social actors in movements leading to social change? What changes 'individuals' into 'people' when they participate in movements? Do strong leaders deprive the followers of their agency? The course shall work with popular culture representations, including songs, visuals, movies, social media posts, political speeches, campaign posters, and election manifestoes of political parties as data for analysis. Students will receive hands-on experience in advanced qualitative analysis anchored in social identity and self-categorisation frameworks.\n",
